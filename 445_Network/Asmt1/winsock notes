winsock notes: 

Streaming socket: SOCK_STREAM
	* Used for TCP connection when reliability is important
	* Binding: associate specific address to a given socket

Using sockets: 
	* Client side: create a socket, call connect(address). 
		* winsock picks IP and any free  port number 
		* IP must be picked from either internet IP, local IP (192.168.x.x) and loop back address (127.0.0.1)

	*Server side: 
		* Listens to incoming connections from specific ports 
		* Creates new socket when data must be sent to keep listening socket undisturbed. 


Basic winsock functions: 
	*Initialize winsock library
		*WSAStartup & WSACleanup
	*SOCKET socket(int af, int type, int protocol)
		*creates new socket
		*af: address family to use; AF_INET for TCP & UDP 
		*type: type of socket -> SOCK_STREAM (TCP), SOCK_DGRAM(UDP)
		*protocol: self explanatory
		*return handle to new socket
	*closesocket
		*must always close socket when finished
	*sockaddr
		*used to convert byte order from intel x86 (little-endian) to network ordering (big-endian)
	*connect
		*connects socket with remote socket
	*binding
		*server
		*usually done before putting socket in listening state
	*listen
		*server
		*must be bound to an address/port first
	*accept
		*accept incoming connection
		*creates new socket to handle and connect to client socket 
	*send
		* determine socket to send data on and size of data to send
		* returns number of bytes sent 
	*recv
		* receives data and stores it in buffer
