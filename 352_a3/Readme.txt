352 Binary tree/Flex heap assignment 

Changes:
*Added the flex heap functions and made addLeft and addRight work when creating improper tree! (Turns out creating trees using those methods are much much easier than insertLeft/insertRight)
*Functioning methods (all tested)

To add: 
*Proper test cases in main

Note: 
*You can see the changes made between both versions.
